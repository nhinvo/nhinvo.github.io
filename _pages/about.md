I develop and automate computational analyses to make sense of microbial genomics data. I’m skilled in high-performance computing, Python and shell scripting, and data visualization. I find deep satisfaction in streamlining, optimizing, and clearly documenting workflows to make science faster and more reproducible.  

This website presents my [**curriculum vitae **](/cv/), and [**publications**](/publications/).  

Current Research Projects: 
- Comparative Genomics and Pangenomics of Marine Picocyanobacteria.  
- Methylation and base modification of prokaryotes through long-read sequencing.  

Past Research Projects: 
- Structural and Single Nucleotide Variant detection in microbial populations.   
- Meta-transcriptomics analysis of microbial community gene expression.
