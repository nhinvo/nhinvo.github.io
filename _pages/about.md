As a **Bioinformatics Research Associate** at MIT (<a href="httpshttps://chisholmlab.mit.edu/" target="_blank">The Chisholm Lab</a>), I develop and automate computational analyses to make sense of microbial genomics data. I’m skilled in high-performance computing, Python and shell scripting, and data visualization. I find deep satisfaction in streamlining, optimizing, and clearly documenting workflows to make science faster and more reproducible.

Current Research Projects: 
- Comparative Genomics and Pangenomics of Marine Picocyanobacteria 
- Methylation and base modification of prokaryotes through long-read sequencing (PacBio and Nanopore)

Past Research Projects: 
- Structural and Single Nucleotide Variant detection in microbial populations 
- Meta-transcriptomics analysis of microbial community gene expression
