### Crocheted and Knitted Works   <a class="anchor" id="crochet"></a>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Dragon Scale Dice Pouches: 
These little drawstring pouches to hold dice were made as gifts for my friends who played DnD. The pattern for the pouch can be found on Ellie Lenz's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7WT2OMUXo" target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a>. The size of the pouch from the tutorial has been reduced to be more suitable for holding dice.   
<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/dragon_pouch.jpg" width="220"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/dragon_pouch3.jpg" width="220"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/dragon_pouch2.jpg" width="220"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

#### Hats!
Funny hats that were made without any patterns. The green beanie was made by knitting a rectangle and sewing the sides together. 

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/iggy_hat.jpg" width="220"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/iggy_hat2.jpg" width="220"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/knitted_hat.jpg" width="220"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

#### Plushies:


#### Plarn (plastic-yarn) Bag: 
Plastic bags can be converted to plarn using the technique seen in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQwTcizA7Oo" target="_blank">video</a>. Plarn can then be used just like regular yarn. Below is a plarn tote bag that I have been working on using plastic bags gathered from friends, roommates, cultural centers, and clubs.

### Ceramics <a class="anchor" id="ceramics"></a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Planters:
The planter below was hand-built, a ceramics technique that does not involve the pottery wheel, to give it a more organic look. Then it was painted using <a href="https://ceramica.fandom.com/wiki/Underglaze" target="_blank">underglaze</a>, which provided better control over color placement, before the piece was fired with clear glaze to seal all the colors in. Unfortunately, while inside the kiln, glaze from a piece above dripped onto the planter.  

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="/assets/img/my-art/ceramics/cer_0a.png" width="220"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/cer_0b.png" width="220"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/cer_0c.png" width="220"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

This second planter was made using a pottery wheel, hence its sides are straighter. In addition, the planter was fired with glaze instead of underglaze.

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="/assets/img/my-art/ceramics/cer_1c.png" width="220"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/cer_1b.png" width="220"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="/assets/img/my-art/crochet/cer_1a.png" width="220"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
