### My Projects (Page in progress)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This page includes summary of some of the work I have completed for my undergraduate research, independent project, and coursework projects.   
#### Undergraduate research work:  
I was fortunate to be able to work with professor Daisuke Kihara in the Kihara Bioinormatics Laboratory ivestigating the potential of generative machine learning methods in novel drug molecule generation. I have included 2 pages that briefly describe some computational work I have done for the analysis of computer generated drug compounds: [Molecular Docking page](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/docking_ligands.html), and [Tanimoto Drug Similarity page](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/tanimoto_calc.html).   


#### Independent project: 
RNA-seq project coming soon. 

#### Coursework project:
