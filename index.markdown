<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>  

<p>Hello! My name is Nhi. I am currently a senior in Genetics at <img src="/assets/img/about_me_img/Screenshot (298).png" alt="nhivo" width="220" height="220" style="float:right" border="20">Purdue University.</p> Aside from my strong interest in molecular biology, especially in genetics and genomics, I am also interested in computational methods developed to analyze biological datasets. 
During my undergraduate program, I have had the chance to work with professor Daisuke Kihara in his bioinformatics laboratory, and with Dr. Martinez, a postdoc from the Kawahara Lab at the Florida Museum of Natural History. From those experiences, I had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of biological dataset, including protein structures, small drug molecules, genomic data, transcriptome data, phylogenetic data, etc.
