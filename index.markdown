<p>Hello! My name is Nhi. I am currently a senior in Genetics at Purdue University.</p> Aside from my strong interest in molecular biology, especially in genetics and genomics, I am also interested in the application and development of computational methods for high-dimensional "omics" data. 

During my undergraduate program, I have had the opportunity to work in several research labs, each studying different biological issues. Thanks to that, I was able to apply a variety of bioinformatics and cheminformatics softwares to understand the diverse range of biological dataset studied in each lab. 

This site includes some of the work I have done during my undergraduate research, along with projects for my courses at Purdue.
