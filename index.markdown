<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>  

<p>Hello! My name is Nhi. I am currently a senior in Genetics at <img src="/assets/img/about_me_img/Screenshot (298).png" alt="nhivo" width="220" height="220" style="float:right" hspace="20" vspace="20">Purdue University.</p> Aside from my strong interest in molecular biology, especially in genetics and genomics, I am also interested in computational methods developed to analyze biological datasets. 
During my undergraduate program, I have had the opportunity to work with professor Daisuke Kihara in his bioinformatics laboratory, and with Dr. Martinez, a postdoc from the Kawahara Lab at the Florida Museum of Natural History. I have experience in working with a diverse range of biological datasets, including protein structures, small drug molecules, genomic data, transcriptome data, phylogenetic data, and etc. In addition, I got to apply a variety of bioinformatics and cheminformatics softwares, such as RDKit, Autodock Vina, PyMol, SAMtools, BWA, and etc. to understand the biological datasets studied in each lab. 
This site includes some of the work I have done during undergraduate research, along with projects for my courses at Purdue.
